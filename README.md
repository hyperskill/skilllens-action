## ✨ Why SkillLens?

- ✅ **Zero Configuration** — Works out of the box with your existing GitHub
  workflow
- 🔒 **Privacy-First** — Only reads review comments, never your source code
- 🎯 **AI-Powered Intelligence** — Contextual understanding, not keyword
  matching
- 📚 **Curated Learning Paths** — Direct links to relevant Hyperskill courses
  and topics
- 🤖 **Non-Intrusive** — Single, auto-updating comment per PR (no notification
  spam)
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast** — Typical execution under 10 seconds

Perfect for teams building a **culture of continuous learning**, open-source
projects supporting **contributor growth**, and developers seeking
**personalized skill development**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Add this workflow to `.github/workflows/skilllens.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: SkillLens Learning Recommendations

on:
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted, edited]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]

permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group:
    skilllens-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number
    }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  skilllens:
    if:
      ${{ github.event_name != 'issue_comment' ||
      github.event.issue.pull_request }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: hyperskill/skilllens-action@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**That's it!** 🎉 The action will now automatically post learning
recommendations when reviewers provide feedback.

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Monitors** PR reviews, inline comments, and conversation threads
1. **Filters** noise (LGTM, emojis) to focus on substantive feedback
1. **Analyzes** comments using AI to identify learning opportunities
1. **Matches** topics with Hyperskill's comprehensive course catalog
1. **Posts** a single, updateable comment with personalized recommendations

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

> **Your code stays yours.** SkillLens is built on privacy-first principles.

### What We Access

✅ PR review comments and feedback ✅ Repository metadata (name, PR number) ✅
Public PR conversation threads

### What We DON'T Access

❌ Your source code ❌ File contents ❌ Private repository data ❌ Secrets or
credentials

### Authentication

- Uses GitHub's secure OIDC tokens (no API keys required)
- Tokens are short-lived and scoped to the workflow
- Backend verification ensures only legitimate GitHub Actions can call our API

### Required Permissions

| Permission      | Level | Purpose                                            |
| --------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `pull-requests` | write | Read PR review comments and create/update comments |
| `id-token`      | write | Request OIDC authentication token                  |

> **Note:** The `pull-requests: write` permission typically covers both reading
> PR data and writing comments. If you encounter permission issues, see the
> [troubleshooting section](#-troubleshooting) for alternative configurations.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Does SkillLens read my source code?</b></summary>

No. SkillLens only analyzes PR review comments and feedback. It never accesses
your repository's source code, ensuring complete privacy and security.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What programming languages are supported?</b></summary>

SkillLens supports all languages available on Hyperskill, including:

- Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Kotlin, Go, Scala, C++
- SQL, Bash, and more

The `default-language` input helps optimize recommendations when the repository
language cannot be automatically detected.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use this with private repositories?</b></summary>

Yes! SkillLens works with both public and private repositories. It uses GitHub's
built-in authentication and only accesses review comments, which are already
visible to workflow runs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How accurate are the recommendations?</b></summary>

SkillLens uses advanced AI to understand context and nuance in review comments.
The default confidence threshold of 0.65 ensures only relevant recommendations
are shown. You can adjust this with the `min-confidence` input.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will this spam my PRs with comments?</b></summary>

No. SkillLens maintains a single comment per PR that updates in place. It uses a
hidden HTML marker to identify and update the same comment, preventing
notification spam.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if the SkillLens API is down?</b></summary>

By default, the action logs a warning but doesn't fail your workflow. You can
change this behavior by setting `fail-on-proxy-error: true`.

</details>

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Common Issues and Solutions</b></summary>

### "Resource not accessible by integration"

**Error message:**

```text
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```

**Cause:** Insufficient GitHub token permissions for accessing PR data or
creating comments. This typically occurs when the workflow lacks proper
permissions for the repository.

**Solution 1:** Ensure you have the minimal required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  id-token: write
```

**Solution 2:** If the minimal permissions don't work due to repository
settings, try this expanded configuration:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read # Repository metadata access
  pull-requests: write # PR review and comment access
  issues: read # Additional PR comment read access
  id-token: write # OIDC authentication
```

**Note:** Repository settings can vary, and some organizations may require
additional permissions depending on their security policies. For
organization-owned repositories, check that "Allow GitHub Actions to create and
approve pull requests" is enabled in Settings → Actions → General → Workflow
permissions.

### "Unable to get ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL env variable"

**Error message:**

```text
Error message: Unable to get ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL env variable
```

**Cause:** Missing `id-token: write` permission. GitHub Actions only provides
the OIDC token environment variables when this permission is explicitly granted.

**Solution:** Add the `id-token: write` permission to your workflow:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  id-token: write # Required for OIDC authentication
```

Without `id-token: write`, the action cannot authenticate with the SkillLens
backend and will fail immediately after fetching review data.

### "No comment appears after reviews"

**Possible causes:**

1. No actionable feedback (filtered noise like "LGTM")
1. Confidence threshold not met
1. API communication issue

**Debug steps:**

1. Enable debug logging using one of these methods:
   - Re-run the job with debug logging from GitHub UI (click "Re-run jobs" →
     "Enable debug logging")
   - Add a secret named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` with value `true` to your
     repository
1. Lower the confidence threshold for testing:

```yaml
- uses: hyperskill/skilllens-action@v1
  with:
    min-confidence: 0.5 # Lower threshold for testing
```

### "Action runs but fails immediately"

**Check:**

1. Workflow permissions are correctly set
1. Action is triggered on correct events
1. Repository allows GitHub Actions to create comments

**For organizations:** Go to Repository Settings → Actions → General → Workflow
permissions → Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
